# Contact Book

This project is specially curated for the intermediate Python learners, aiming to highlight the vital role of **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in database management. A database is a systematic collection of data, making the process of data management more streamlined. Databases facilitate the storage and manipulation of data, the retrieval of specific information, and ensuring data consistency, integrity, and security. These can include simple systems like your phone's contact list or more complex systems such as customer relationship management databases for multinational corporations.

The project involves developing a Contact Book application that allows users to execute CRUD operations efficiently on their contacts database. The Contact Book will maintain contact details including name, phone number, email, and physical address.

## Understanding CRUD

<img src="./images/crud.png" width="600">

**CRUD** is an acronym for **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete**. These are the four basic operations that you can perform on any data. CRUD forms the backbone of most computer software and web applications as these actions describe the essential functionality a system should have to manage data or a database.

- **Create**: This involves the creation of new entries of data into the database.
- **Read**: This concerns activities related to the retrieval or viewing of existing entries. Data in the database remains unchanged.
- **Update**: This involves the modification or update of existing data. It requires identifying the existing data in the database and then updating it with new information.
- **Delete**: This involves the deletion or removal of existing entries from the database.

Learning how to work with CRUD operations is a cornerstone of understanding how to build applications that persist and manipulate data. Our proposed Contact Book project is designed to help you grasp these concepts by implementing CRUD operations on your contacts database.
