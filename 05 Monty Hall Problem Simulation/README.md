# Monty Hall Problem Simulation

A Streamlit app to visualize simulations of the Monty Hall problem, highlighting the statistical advantage of switching choices.


## Introduction

The Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle based on a TV game show. This project provides an interactive way to simulate the game multiple times to empirically demonstrate the probabilities of winning by either sticking with the initial choice or by switching after one of the non-selected doors has been revealed to hide a goat.

The application is built with Python, utilizing the [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) library to create the web interface, and allows users to run multiple simulations and observe the outcome.

## Installation and Usage

To get started with the password generator app, you need to have Python installed on your system. This project also requires the additional libraries specified in `requirements.txt`.

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

2. Navigate to the project directory

3. Install the required Python packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. First navigate to `src` directory then run the Streamlit app:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

After running the command, Streamlit will launch the app in your default web browser.
